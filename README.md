# UEC-and-Weather-Project
This project focuses on forecasting Urgent and Emergency Care (UEC) activity, specifically A&amp;E attendances, by combining historical NHS data with weather forecasts. The goal was to understand how temperature influences emergency care demand and to produce reliable forecasts that can support healthcare planning and decision-making.
